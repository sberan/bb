/**
 * Echo provider — a complete third-party agent provider plugin.
 *
 * Surfaces demonstrated:
 * - bb.agents.experimental_registerProvider: the provider declaration (id,
 *   picker metadata, and pre-session capability facts). Metadata only — the
 *   implementation is the bridge below, and a declaration without one is
 *   refused.
 * - bb.providerBridge (package.json): the bridge entry `bb plugin build`
 *   bundles into dist/provider-bridge.mjs. The server stores that artifact
 *   content-addressed and enrolled host daemons download, hash-verify, and
 *   run it for every thread on this provider.
 *
 * The bridge itself lives in src/provider-bridge.ts and implements the
 * canonical Provider Bridge Protocol (docs/provider-bridge-protocol.md)
 * minimally but correctly — its conformance test drives the official kit
 * against it in-process.
